                    <h2>3. Legal Basis for Processing</h2>
                    <p>Under the GDPR, we must have a legal basis for processing your personal data. We rely on the following legal bases for processing your personal data:</p>

                    <h3>Contractual Necessity</h3>
                    <p>We process your personal data to perform our contract with you (i.e., to provide you with access to the Service and fulfill our obligations under our Terms of Service).</p>

                    <h3>Legitimate Interests</h3>
                    <p>We process your personal data based on our legitimate interests, such as:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Improving and developing the Service</li>
                        <li>Ensuring the security and proper functioning of the Service</li>
                        <li>Analyzing usage patterns to enhance user experience</li>
                        <li>Marketing our products and services to existing customers</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>We balance our legitimate interests against your rights and interests in the protection of your personal data.</p>

                    <h3>Consent</h3>
                    <p>We process certain personal data based on your consent, such as:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Sending marketing communications (where required by law)</li>
                        <li>Collecting and using certain types of sensitive data</li>
                        <li>Using cookies and similar technologies (where required by law)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>You have the right to withdraw your consent at any time by contacting us or using the opt-out mechanisms provided.</p>

                    <h3>Legal Obligation</h3>
                    <p>We may process your personal data to comply with our legal obligations, such as tax laws, accounting requirements, or responses to valid legal requests from public authorities.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="legal-section" id="data-subject-rights">
                    <h2>4. Your Rights Under GDPR</h2>
                    <p>Under the GDPR, you have the following rights regarding your personal data:</p>

                    <h3>Right to Access</h3>
                    <p>You have the right to request a copy of the personal data we hold about you and information about how we process it.</p>

                    <h3>Right to Rectification</h3>
                    <p>You have the right to request that we correct any inaccurate personal data we hold about you, or complete any incomplete personal data.</p>

                    <h3>Right to Erasure (Right to be Forgotten)</h3>
                    <p>You have the right to request that we delete your personal data in certain circumstances, such as when the data is no longer necessary for the purposes for which it was collected, or when you withdraw consent on which the processing is based.</p>

                    <h3>Right to Restriction of Processing</h3>
                    <p>You have the right to request that we restrict the processing of your personal data in certain circumstances, such as when you contest the accuracy of the data or when you have objected to processing based on legitimate interests while we verify the grounds for processing.</p>

                    <h3>Right to Data Portability</h3>
                    <p>You have the right to receive your personal data in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format, and to transmit that data to another controller without hindrance from us, where technically feasible.</p>

                    <h3>Right to Object</h3>
                    <p>You have the right to object to the processing of your personal data based on our legitimate interests, for direct marketing purposes, or for scientific/historical research and statistics.</p>

                    <h3>Rights Related to Automated Decision-Making and Profiling</h3>
                    <p>You have the right not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing, including profiling, which produces legal effects concerning you or similarly significantly affects you, except in certain limited circumstances.</p>

                    <h3>How to Exercise Your Rights</h3>
                    <p>To exercise any of these rights, please contact us using the information provided in the "Contact Information" section below. We will respond to your request within one month, although we may extend this period by up to two additional months if necessary, taking into account the complexity and number of requests.</p>
                    <p>We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it.</p>
                    <p>You will not have to pay a fee to exercise any of these rights. However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive, or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.</p>

                    <h3>Right to Lodge a Complaint</h3>
                    <p>If you believe that our processing of your personal data infringes data protection laws, you have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority, in particular in the EU Member State of your habitual residence, place of work, or place of the alleged infringement.</p>

                <div class="legal-section" id="data-transfers">
                    <h2>5. International Data Transfers</h2>
                    <p>As a global organization with operations in the United States, we may transfer your personal data to countries outside the EEA, UK, or Switzerland, which may not have data protection laws as comprehensive as those in your country of residence.</p>
                    <p>When we transfer your personal data outside the EEA, UK, or Switzerland, we ensure that appropriate safeguards are in place to protect your personal data, such as:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) approved by the European Commission</li>

                        <li>Adequacy decisions by the European Commission</li>
                        <li>Other legally approved transfer mechanisms</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>6. Data Retention</h2>
                    <p>We retain your personal data only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which we collected it, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements.</p>
                    <p>To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data</li>
                        <li>The potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your personal data</li>
                        <li>The purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means</li>
                        <li>The applicable legal, regulatory, tax, accounting, or other requirements</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>In some circumstances, we may anonymize your personal data (so that it can no longer be associated with you) for research or statistical purposes, in which case we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you.</p>

                <div class="legal-section" id="data-protection">
                    <h2>7. Data Protection Measures</h2>
                    <p>We have implemented appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk of processing your personal data, including:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Encryption of personal data</li>
                        <li>Ability to ensure the ongoing confidentiality, integrity, availability, and resilience of processing systems and services</li>
                        <li>Ability to restore the availability and access to personal data in a timely manner in the event of a physical or technical incident</li>
                        <li>Regular testing, assessing, and evaluating of the effectiveness of technical and organizational measures for ensuring the security of the processing</li>
                        <li>Staff training and awareness programs</li>
                        <li>Access controls and authentication procedures</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>We ensure that all third-party service providers who process personal data on our behalf also implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect your personal data.</p>
